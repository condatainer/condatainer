// Package orchestrate composes internal/project and internal/project/lock
// steps that a caller — `cmd/project.go`'s `project lock`, and the
// dashboard's project creation — needs run in a fixed sequence. It exists as its

// internal/project (for LookupAt/LookupLocal), so internal/project itself
// can never import internal/project/publish back without a cycle; this
// package sits above both instead.
