// Why a registry operation failed, as the categories a caller acts on.
//
// They are sentinels rather than one error type because nothing reads a field
// off them — a caller recognizes a case and branches. The split is by *what the
// caller does*, which is the only line worth drawing: an artifact that is absent
// or unreachable may be built locally instead, while a credential problem or a
// wrong artifact must be reported. Silently rebuilding a forty-minute index
// because a token expired is a worse outcome than an error.
