// An entry is one directory holding manifest.json plus exactly the rebuild
// sources that manifest names. The same directory appears in two places — inside
// an image at /.cnt/provenance, and in a checkout at cnt-lock/provenance — and
// it has to mean the same thing in both, because a lock is verified against
// records an image produced. Reading one therefore lives here rather than once
// per consumer: two readers that drift give a lock that verifies and an image
// that does not, or the reverse.

// Reader reads one file of an entry directory, given its full path. Callers
// supply their own so the policy for untrusted bytes stays theirs: a checkout's
// entries are tracked Git content and are read with a size bound and a symlink
// refusal, while an image's come straight off an extraction.
